### 2025-11-18: Andy

Discussed Papers:

[Back to basics: Little Red Dots as galaxies and dust-obscured AGNs in a synthetic NIRCamsky simulated with L-GalaxiesBH](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10725) (Herrero-Carrión et al., 11-2025)
- Restframe UV-optical emission is dominated by AGN and dust absorption is secondary.
- LDRs host lighter MBHs and fainter emission unable to balance Balmer break.
- No evidence of dominant heavy-seed MBHs

[Gravitational Wave Phase shifts of black hole mergers in AGN Disks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15193) (Tagawa et al., 11-2025)
- If the BBH is accelerating (for example, because it's orbiting a SMBH in an AGN disk, or being yanked by a nearby third black hole), this motion imprints a specific distortion on the waveform.

Presented Paper:

[Multi-messenger constraints on LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational wave binary black holes merging in AGN disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20767) (Cabrera et al., 10-2025)
- 300 Binary BH mergers detected - > 95% of detections are BBH mergrs
- EM confirmation is low (maybe ~ dozen)
- More work for mergers is needed
- Formation channel: AGN, ADs
- AGN intrinsically variable without BBH events -> AGN flare challenging to assosciate
- Statistically not good enough yet
- $1\times10^{-8}$ flares per AGN per day
- Most likely explination is most EM events are random flares instead of mergers
- $\lambda$ is consistent with $\lambda=0$ case
- <3% of LVK BBHs produce detectable flares
- Constraints allow for around <40% LVK BBH events originate in disk of AGN
  

### 2025-11-11: Darius

Discussed papers:

[Probing AGN-ISM Feedback through Extended X-ray Emission in ESO 137-G034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22453) (Król et al., 10-2025)
- Use radial profiles to investigate extended X-ray emission at different energies.
- Possible shock emission assiciated with the termination of a radio jet.
- Thermal X-ray and photoionized emission in the inner region.
- Radial and mechanical feedback appears to be impacting the inner 1kpc environment.


Presented Papers:

[The strong Fe K line and spin of the black-hole X-ray binary MAXI J1631-479](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03386) (Zdziarski et al., 11-2025)

- Intrinisic Fe K disk emission and disk irradiation by BB emission are previous models; Kerr disk model used here with thin disk
- XRB outburst in 2018
- V strong broad Fe K emission
- NuSTAR & NICER light curves show soft-to-hard transitionary state
- High E tales in soft state - leads to stronger illumination of disk
- Disk Models: Kerrbb & slimbh 
- Spin parameters across both parts are vastly different for kerbb but closer to agreement for slimbh
- They suggest a need for a slim disk model
- Strongly absorbed source (observed flux is 4 times smaller than detected flux)
- They justify their conclusion of the observed Fe-K line being explained by irradiation from Compton scattering of BB photons despite the limitations they mention by using xilconv

### 2025-11-04: Jiachen

Discussed Papers:

[XRISM Spectroscopy of the Stellar-mass Black Hole GRS 1915+105](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25089) (Miller et al., 10-2025)
- traditional type-1 Stella-mass BH transitioning to type-2. 
- Nice image included of a warped AD: A stellar-mass black hole which transformed from "type-1"-like to "type-2"-like with its central engine now obscured by warm, Compton-thick gas and exhibiting strong photoionized emission lines and radiative recombination continuum features.

- NuSTAR no compton hump
- Low density at sublimation limit. Weak/neutral Fe - $k\alpha$
- Again another nice figure: Revealing a radially stratified iron line emitting structure that spans nearly four orders of magnitude in radius, with evidence for distinct emission components from the inner disk and broad-line region, placing the source in an intermediate accretion state where the inner disk and broad-line region persist while the torus shows signs of dissipation.

[XRISM/Resolve Spectroscopy of the Central Engine in the Seyfert-1 AGN Mrk 279](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20083) (Miller et al., 10-2025)
- tentative evidence for UFOs
- Basically Xrism resolving narrow absorption features in hard X-rays
- 'Sy-1 with distinct velocity components in the Fe-Kα emission line linked to the molecular torus, broad line region (BLR), and inner accretion disk, along with tentative evidence for ultra-fast outflows (UFOs)'

Presented paper:

[A Sharper View of the X-ray Spectrum of MCG–6-30-15 with XRISM, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08926) (Brenneman et al., 10-2025)
- z=0.00775, Host is NL syfert-1. Small BH Mass, not too broad optical lines so similar to syfert-2
- High spectral resolution, can we look at disc reflection? (No)
- Possible lamppost model does not work well
- Reflection model is always lower than expected from lamppost - not too bad to assume since an out-flowing corona is possible and therefore can appear similar to a moving lamp post model.
- Need a stronger compton hump if you have a higher power law cut off or no cut off

Discussed Papers:

[Discovery of Powerful Multi-Velocity Ultra-Fast Outflows in the Starburst Merger Galaxy IRAS 05189−2524 with XRISM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18027) (Noda et al., 10-2025)
- "Crucial role for these outflows in galaxy evolution during a transitional phase preceding the quasar phase."
- XRISM observations with outflows at 0.076c, 0.101c and 0.143c
- Recently merged and undergoing SF
- Slower closer in, but hotter 
- Consistent with radiative drivin
- AGN feedback to quench SF but not there yet - in transition to quasar

[A supermassive black hole under the radar: repeating X-ray variability in a Seyfert galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02832) (Imbrogno et al., 10-2025)
- Revealing short-term quasi-periodic oscillations or flare-like behaviours (QPO vs QPE; see [Variability in a low-mass active galactic nucleus: oscillation or eruption?](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.518.3428W/abstract) (Webbe & Young, 01-2023)
- QPE and QPO connections? They don't know
- QPE and QPO models can both fit the data somewhat well

[XRISM constraints on unidentified X-ray emission lines, including the 3.5 keV line, in the stacked spectrum of ten galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24560) (XRISM Collaboration et al., 10-2025)
- 'no unidenified lines are detected in the stacked spectrum'
- In relation to [Detection of An Unidentified Emission Line in the Stacked X-ray spectrum of Galaxy Clusters](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/789/1/13) (Bulbul et al., 06-2014) reporting a weak line at 3.5 keV (decay of sterile neutrino, warm dark matter particles candidate?) XRISM paper doesn't find anything
- but not as sensitive as XMM so not ruled out

Presented paper:
[Investigating the emission mechanism in the spatially-resolved jet of two z≈3 radio-loud quasars](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09676) (Maithil et al., 04-2025)
- 2 high redshift quasars with Chandra X-ray resolved jets with high-res radio follow up Exploring the iC/CMB
- Power of jetted outflows is useful to understand the formation and growth of galaxies due to the BH formation & evolution links to the host formation and evolution
- Mechanical energy outflow can exceed totla radiation output of SMBH after cosmic noon.
- Directly detected X-ray jets can be used to calculate enthalpy if produced by iC/CMB
- at $z>3$ with a bulk lorentz factor $\Gamma\sim4$ CMB energy density dominates synchrotron energy density for a $B<100\text{s }\mu\text{G}$
- Higher $B$ gives Synchrotron domination
- Doppler factor from X-ray fluxes can be used to calculate enthaly flux
- iC/CMB dominant emission corresponds to lack of radio jet detection
- One source (J1405+0415) is near the equatorial plane leading to issues with RFI - they discuss how they mitigated this with their observation.
- 3C 286 was their flux calibrator which remains unresolved at this level and therefore makes a good flux calibration target. They used a phase calibrator in a loop with the science target, which is standard practice (LOFAR uses a phase calibrator in its field of view)
- Pile-up reduced by a 1/4 subarray type. They used subpixel image alignment - standard reprocess was used beyond this.
-  They observed a knot in J1405+0415 near the core, resolvable with 0.3" resolution (the synthesised beam (resolution) is 0.29"x0.25")
- Neither had a continuous radio jet to connect the HSs and core.
- They subpixelised to the radio resolution of 0.25"
- They investigate the a circle with 90% of the emission from the core (~0.1") over the now-standard 0.5-7.0 keV energy range
- They model the just a power law with galactic absorption, then add in the intrinsic absorption and say they find "including an intrinsic absorber does not significantly improve the fit" yet they still end up with the conclusion of intrinsic absorption of around $n_{H}\sim5\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ which is a typical value for type I.
- They fit power law and HR models for each individual observation and the merged observation but notable they seem slightly inconsistent so it could be interesting to look at the dates of the observations which they do not supply.
- When looking at the PSF model they note changes in the HRMA likely are not included in SAOTrace leading to issues with the AspectBlur
- They observe evidence for extended emission but one of the extension regions (within 1") they attribute to the HRMA known asymmetric smearing  
- It seems they spend a decent amount of time on emission structure within with central 1" yet admit the blurring from chandra means they cannot realisitically use widths smaller than about 1.5" for the jet axis.
- Since they cannot see the radio jet they assume a jet radius of 3kpc
- They first investigate iC/CMB and use a cylindrical jet model of 3kpc radius
- Using properties of the expressions for jet rest-frame magnetic field and observed magnetic field, they generate an expression that relies on the bulk lorentz factor, $\Gamma$, and angle $\theta$ that and determine a most-probable line-of-sight.
- They show that the radio-emitting e- lifetime is shorter than the X-ray iC/CMB emitting e-, and the population responsible is around 144MHz or less
- They find factors $\theta$, $n_e$, B and KE scale relative to the radio--X-ray flux

- Evidence for Shock ionisation and radiation bounded AGN photoionisation.
- Beam smearing effects could lead to over estimates of outflows and kinematics by orders of magnitude.

- $\sim10^{49}$ to $\sim10^{44} \text{ erg s}^{-1}$ drop off in 20 days
- Soft-component dominates late in transient suggesting super Eddington

[A rapid black hole spin or emission from the plunging region?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13119) (A. Mummery et al., 05-2025)
- Simplist model around BH (Sunyeav disk) + relativisitic corrections assume no emission from the 'plunging' region
- Slightly perturbed near ISCO means free-fall into BH
- Infalling gas loses GPE -> KE & Heat. Heat radiated locally as Black body
- Cooler disk for higher mass
- Neglecting emission from within ISCO is a poor approximation especially from B-fields which plays a key role in accretion
- Enhance strength of B-fields within ISCO
- Schwartzchild BH and Kerr BH could look similar if there is emission within the ISCO for the Schwartzchild BH
- Can't rely on continuum fitting methods
- Good to consider what is happening inside the ISCO
- Paczynski 2000 paper - torque cannot be assumed arbitrarily since it is determined by its value at the BH surface. Torque is still important inside the ISCO.

[A Bolometric Luminosity Correction Recipe for AGN at Any Epoch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19666v1) (M. Azadi et al., 09-2025)
- Paper on looking at different parameters to probe bolomentric correction (total luminosity)
- Based on fact from Intrinsic from IR to UV

Presented Paper:
[The Broadband View of the Bare Seyfert PG 1426+015: Relativistic Reflection, the Soft Excess and the Importance of Oxygen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13411) (D. Walton et al., 09-2025)
- Seyfert PG 1426+015 - almost zero galactic absorption evident
- Near Consistent flux, HR changes a little
- Possible anti-correlation for HR and flux
- OVII emission seen, otherwise it appears completely absorption free in RGS data
- Relativistically broadened Fe line
- Broken Power law appears to be a better fit than Lamppost model at higher energies
- XILVER model has weaker soft excess than REFLIONX, due to the returned densities being different (XILVER is lower) and XILVER has lower free-free contribution
- Assume same OVIII abundance but XILVER has a higher emission
- XILVER model appears to pivot the power law due to the OVIII flux which leads to a poorer fit to the hard component
- Allowing a weaker OVIII would allow for XILVER to fit the model better
- XILVER does not seem to accurately treat opacities in the AD which could cause the higher line flux in the model meaning it can be plausible to add absorption to the OVIII
- REFLIONX treats the line emission as an escape fraction which can lead to a more realisitic model
- XILVER prefers a higher BH spin of $$\sim 0.95$$ whereas REFLIONX prefers a more intermediate spin $$>0.7$$
- Model AD to ISCO but do not place strong constrains
- Largest Reverberation-mapped mass: $$log(M_{BH}/M_\odot) = 9$$
- High density AD $$n_e\sim10^{18}$$
- S/N not sufficient to constrain iron line and compton hump
