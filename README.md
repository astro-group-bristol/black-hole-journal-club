### 2025-10-14: Gloria

Discussed Papers:

[XRISM /Resolve observations of Hercules X-1: vertical structure and kinematics of the disk wind](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07615) (Kosec et al., 10-2025)
- Hercules X-1 - X-ray pulsar, very clear evidence of X-ray wind
- Disk and wind pulsating with same period, LOS crosses different parts of the wind such that a 3D view can be created
- Wind model parameters for different wind orbits
- Similar to [Vertical wind structure in an X-ray binary revealed by a precessing accretion disk](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05490)(Kosec et al., 04-2023):

Presented Paper:
[A novel Reverberation mapping method for blazars](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250916927D/abstract) (J. Deng et al., 09-2025)
- Broad emission lines for kinematic distribution of gas, but accretion disk gives time delay from emission lines.
	- Measure by Discrete correlation function 
	- Interpolated cross-correlation function
	- Local cross-correlation function
- Emission dominated by AD and jet, so can be useful to disentangle jet & AD component for blazars
- Compare contribution on thermal and non-thermal emission
- Non-thermal dominance (NTD) parameter less than 2 then quiescent states and unpredictable  
- Positive Specral index in optical window
- They select 2 flat spectrum blazars to test approach with a combined 501 spectra
- They look at $\text{H}\beta$ $\text{H}\gamma$ and [OIII] emission lines
- telluric absorption near $\text{H}\beta$ in PSK 1510-089
- They found negligible host galaxy contribution
- Shakura-sunyaev disk model
- 3 fitting models: Only jets, Only disk, and both
- Generally find only jets or both jets and disk models are preferred, no cases are well modelled by only the disk model
- Their method does not work if the blue bump is not detected 
- [Spatially resolved broad line region in a quasar at z=4: Dynamical black hole mass and prominent outflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13911) (GRAVITY+ Collaboration, 09-2025) - Resolve BLR at z=4 and dynamically determined mass - 10 smaller than single epoch scaling methods. Difference could be due to BLR being outflowing.

Discussed Papers:

[A fast powerful X-ray transient from tidal disruption of a white dwarf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25877) (D.-Y. Li et al., 09-2025)
- Fast luminous X-ray transient (1-day) of a WD-TDE indicated relativistic jet emission
- $\sim10^{49}$ to $\sim10^{44} \text{ erg s}^{-1}$ drop off in 20 days
- Soft-component dominates late in transient suggesting super Eddington

[Unification models of active galactic nuclei](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443214394000808?via%3Dihub) (C. Ricci, 01-2026)

[Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05132) (C. Ricci & B. Trakhtenbrot, 11-2022)

[The Disk Plus (Failed) Wind System of 3C 47: A Story of Accretion Disks and Binary Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01972) (P. Marziani, 10-2025)

Presented Paper:
[A rapid black hole spin or emission from the plunging region?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13119) (A. Mummery et al., 05-2025)
- Simplist model around BH (Sunyeav disk) + relativisitic corrections assume no emission from the 'plunging' region
- Slightly perturbed near ISCO means free-fall into BH
- Infalling gas loses GPE -> KE & Heat. Heat radiated locally as Black body
- Cooler disk for higher mass
- Neglecting emission from within ISCO is a poor approximation especially from B-fields which plays a key role in accretion
- Enhance strength of B-fields within ISCO
- Schwartzchild BH and Kerr BH could look similar if there is emission within the ISCO for the Schwartzchild BH
- Can't rely on continuum fitting methods
- Good to consider what is happening inside the ISCO
- Paczynski 2000 paper - torque cannot be assumed arbitrarily since it is determined by its value at the BH surface. Torque is still important inside the ISCO.
- [Multi-mission view of extragalactic black hole X-ray binaries LMC X-1 and LMC X-3: Evolution of broadband spectral features](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117721007596) (G. Bhuvana et al., 01-2022)


### 2025-09-30: Darius

Discussed papers:

[A Bolometric Luminosity Correction Recipe for AGN at Any Epoch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19666v1) (M. Azadi et al., 09-2025)
- Paper on looking at different parameters to probe bolomentric correction (total luminosity)
- Based on fact from Intrinsic from IR to UV

Presented Paper:
[The Broadband View of the Bare Seyfert PG 1426+015: Relativistic Reflection, the Soft Excess and the Importance of Oxygen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13411) (D. Walton et al., 09-2025)
- Seyfert PG 1426+015 - almost zero galactic absorption evident
- Near Consistent flux, HR changes a little
- Possible anti-correlation for HR and flux
- OVII emission seen, otherwise it appears completely absorption free in RGS data
- Relativistically broadened Fe line
- Broken Power law appears to be a better fit than Lamppost model at higher energies
- XILVER model has weaker soft excess than REFLIONX, due to the returned densities being different (XILVER is lower) and XILVER has lower free-free contribution
- Assume same OVIII abundance but XILVER has a higher emission
- XILVER model appears to pivot the power law due to the OVIII flux which leads to a poorer fit to the hard component
- Allowing a weaker OVIII would allow for XILVER to fit the model better
- XILVER does not seem to accurately treat opacities in the AD which could cause the higher line flux in the model meaning it can be plausible to add absorption to the OVIII
- REFLIONX treats the line emission as an escape fraction which can lead to a more realisitic model
- XILVER prefers a higher BH spin of $$\sim 0.95$$ whereas REFLIONX prefers a more intermediate spin $$>0.7$$
- Model AD to ISCO but do not place strong constrains
- Largest Reverberation-mapped mass: $$log(M_{BH}/M_\odot) = 9$$
- High density AD $$n_e\sim10^{18}$$
- S/N not sufficient to constrain iron line and compton hump
